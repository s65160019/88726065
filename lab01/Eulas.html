    <h1>Eula skill</h1>
    When this skill hits at least one enemy, it generates 1.5 Elemental Particles if it was pressed and 2.5 if it was held.
<br>Each Grimheart buff stack is indicated at their gain by an icon above eula and during their possession by the intensity of her mantle's glow, with the first stack showing a sword icon and giving her mantle a slight glow, and the second stack showing an icon of two crossed swords and giving her mantle a bright glow.
<br><b>Passive Effects</b>
